# Getting Ready for the Class

Python runs on most home computers, including those that run macOS, Windows and Linux. Please install the software described below and [make the payment for the class](https://buy.stripe.com/fZe9BL6vug0AcaA144) if you haven't done so already.

## Windows

What we need for this class will not run in Windows 10 with S mode. If you have Windows 10 with S mode, you will need to turn off S mode, or get a different computer to run the software that we need.

**Please contact me if you need any help installing this software or have any questions before class starts.**

1.	Open the Microsoft Store App and search for “Python”
2.	You’ll see many results. Select “Python 3.10” only. It should be free, and from the Python Software Foundation
3.	Click “Get”
4.	Wait for the app to download. The “Get” button will change to “Install on my devices.” Click that, and then click “Install now” to start the installation. If all is well, you should see a message saying “The product is installed.”
5.	Hit the Windows key on your keyboard and type in `cmd` and then hit the ‘Enter’ key 
6.	In the black window, type in `python --version` and then hit the ‘Enter’ key. It should print “Python 3.10.1” or higher 
7.	Type in `pip install pygame` and then hit the ‘Enter’ key. Type in `pip install pyttsx3` and then hit the ‘Enter’ key.
